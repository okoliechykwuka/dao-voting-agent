# DAO Voting Application

This project is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform built using **FastAPI**, **Web3.py**, and **LangChain**. It allows users to create proposals, vote on them, and interact with the DAO through a conversational AI assistant.

---

## Features

- **Create Proposals**: Submit new proposals for the DAO.
- **Vote on Proposals**: Cast votes on existing proposals.
- **View Proposals**: Retrieve all proposals and their details.
- **Check Balance**: View user balances in Ether.
- **Voting History**: Check the voting history for a specific address.
- **Proposal Analysis**: Analyze proposals for clarity and potential impact using an AI assistant.
- **AI Assistant**: Chat with an AI assistant for DAO-related queries.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Web3.py**: A Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okoliechykwuka/dao-voting-agent.git
cd dao-voting-agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed, then create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install fastapi[all] web3 langchain
```

### 3. Configure the Smart Contract

Update the **`CONTRACT_ABI`** in `endpoints.py` with your smart contract's ABI. Ensure the following are correctly set to connect to your Ethereum network:

- **`WEB3_PROVIDER`**
- **`CONTRACT_ADDRESS`**
- **`CHAIN_ID`**

### 4. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Access the API

Open your browser and navigate to:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
